# Neural-numerical-replicability
This project aims to provide tools to analyse the influence of numerical imprecision under different platforms in the context of neural computational replicability, taking as a case study a small neural network composed of Hodgkin-Huxley-type neurons. The simulated model and their parameters are described in _JCN_2019_v4.0_appendix_Eqs_Parameters.pdf_ file. The project was implemented using C/C++ program language. The Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) were solved using Rungeâ€“Kutta fourth-order method (RK4), implemented by Boost C++ library, specifically Boost.Numeric.Odeint module.

# Software requirements:
- C/C++ compiler (ex: gcc)
- Make builder
- Boost C++ libraries (http://www.boost.org)<br>
    ODEint module, to solving ordinary differential equations, is include in the distribution

# How to compile the C++ source code 
1. Edit the make file *Makefile*
   - path for the compiler and Boost library. 
   - To use double, long double or Boost precision, you should comment/uncomment the lines (9-16) on ``checkActualPrecision.h`` code based on your choice. 
2. Execute the make command.
3. Make sure that your HH_BBT2017_allP.exe file was created
4. Create a directory named "results", as the same of here (with lowercase r)
5. For simulations with 100% excitatorys neurons with vInh = 70 mV (Figure 1 and Figure 2B) type the following line code:
```HH_BBT2017_allP.exe -pExcN 1.0 -vInh 70```

- Then, case double precision was seleted, It will create four files in the results directory, :
	- HH_BBT_rk4_dt0100_100,0,vI70,t=8s_double_IappDES,Epis.txt
	- HH_BBT_rk4_dt0100_100,0,vI70,t=8s_double_IappDES,Iapp.txt
	- HH_BBT_rk4_dt0100_100,0,vI70,t=8s_double_IappDES.txt
	- HH_BBT_rk4_dt0100_100_0_vI_70_t8s_double_IappDES_Spikes.m

6. For simulations with 80/20% Excitatory/Inhibitory with vInh = 70 mV (Figure 2C) type the following line code:
```HH_BBT2017_allP.exe -pExcN 0.8 -vInh 70```
- Then, It will create four files inside the results directory:
	- HH_BBT_rk4_dt0100_100,20,vI70,t=8s_double_IappDES,Epis.txt
	- HH_BBT_rk4_dt0100_100,20,vI70,t=8s_double_IappDES,Iapp.txt
	- HH_BBT_rk4_dt0100_100,20,vI70,t=8s_double_IappDES.txt
	- HH_BBT_rk4_dt0100_100_20_vI_70_t8s_double_IappDES_Spikes.m

>>Note: Case you set long double or Boost precision (check step 1), the name of your files will be:<br>
	- \*t=8s_long_double_\*.txt<br>
	- \*t=8s_boost_double_\*.txt<br> 
	
# How generate the figures
***After generated the files for each platform and each precision***
- Figure 1
1. Open the **Fig1_as.m** file from _figures_ directory on Matlab software.
2. Set the variables 'path_to_directory' on the lines 5 (for Windows file), 18 (for MacOs file) and 31 (for Linux file) for  each platform.
3. Verify that the names of the files read are the same within the directories. Line 6 for Windows, line 19 for MacOs and line 32 for Linux file.
