# neural-numerical-replicability
This project was implemented using C/C++ program language. The ODEs were solved using Rungeâ€“Kutta fourth-order method (RK4), implemented by Boost C++ library, specifically Boost.Numeric.Odeint module.

# Software requirements:
- C/C++ compiler (ex: gcc)<br>
- Boost C++ libraries (http://www.boost.org)
    ODEint module, to solving ordinary differential equations, is include in the distribution

# To execute the six scenarios: 
  Double precision:
    // A neural network composed of 100 excitatory neurons 
    $	HH_BBT2017_doubleP -pExcN 1.0  
    // A neural network composed of 80/20 of excitatory/inhibitory neurons respectively. 
    $	HH_BBT2017_doubleP -pExcN 0.8 -vInh 10
