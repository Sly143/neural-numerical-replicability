# neural-numerical-replicability
This project aims to provide tools to analyse the influence of numerical imprecision under different platforms in the context of neural computational replicability, taking as a case study a small neural network composed of Hodgkin-Huxley-type neurons. The simulated models and their parameters are described in JCN_2019_Eqs_Parameters.pdf file. The project was implemented using C/C++ program language. The Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) were solved using Rungeâ€“Kutta fourth-order method (RK4), implemented by Boost C++ library, specifically Boost.Numeric.Odeint module.

# Software requirements:
- C/C++ compiler (ex: gcc)
- Make builder
- Boost C++ libraries (http://www.boost.org)
    ODEint module, to solving ordinary differential equations, is include in the distribution

**How to compile**
> **If your platform is Windows**
- Double
1. Open the **_double_** directory and edit the make file *MakefileWin*, with the correct path for the compiler and Boost library. Then, execute the make command.
